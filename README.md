# ninety-nine-clojure
My New Year's resolution for 2014: I am going to solve 99 Clojure problems inspired by ["S-99: Ninety Nine Scala Problems](href="http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/) and ["P-99: Ninety Nine Prolog Problems"](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems). It might be a bit ambitious, but we will see.

Read [my blog](http://pbrc.blogspot.com/2014/01/ninety-nine-clojure-problems.html) for comments on the individual solutions.
